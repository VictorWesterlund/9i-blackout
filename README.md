# Screen blackout for the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i
Blackout one screen of your [Lenovo Yoga Book 9i laptop](https://web.archive.org/web/20230723222014/https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/yoga/yoga-2-in-1-series/yoga-book-9i-gen-8-(13-inch-intel)/len101y0028). This is perfect for watching movies on one screen and you just want the other screen to go dark without having to change windows display settings.

The screen will go completely black thanks to the 9i's OLED screens. And it will also prevent burn-ins!
